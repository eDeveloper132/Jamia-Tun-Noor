## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a boilerplate for a Node.js application, designed to provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable web services or APIs. It integrates with MongoDB for data persistence and Express.js for handling routes and middleware. The frontend can be developed using Vue.js, making it a full-stack solution.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installing

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd nazim
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or yarn install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in your configurations.

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or npm run dev (if applicable)
   ```
